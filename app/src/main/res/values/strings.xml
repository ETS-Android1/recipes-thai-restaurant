    <string name="Ingredients_food_1">
        1 1/2 cups glutinous (sweet) rice
        1 1/3 cups well-stirred canned unsweetened coconut milk
        1/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons sugar
        1/4 teaspoon salt
        1 tablespoon sesame seeds, toasted lightly
        1 large mango, peeled, pitted, and cut into thin slices (at least 24)

    <string name="Instructions_food_1">
        In a bowl wash rice well in several changes of cold water until water is clear.
        Soak rice in cold water to cover overnight.
        Drain rice well in a sieve.
        Set sieve over a large deep saucepan of simmering water (sieve should not touch water) and steam rice, covered with a kitchen towel and a lid, 30 to 40 minutes, or until tender (check water level in pan occasionally, adding more water if necessary).
        While rice is cooking, in a small saucepan bring 1 cup coconut milk to a boil with 1/3 cup sugar and salt, stirring until sugar is dissolved, and remove from heat.
        Keep mixture warm.
        Transfer cooked rice to a bowl and stir in coconut-milk mixture.
        Let rice stand, covered, 30 minutes, or until coconut-milk mixture is absorbed.
        Rice may be prepared up to this point 2 hours ahead and kept covered at room temperature.
        While rice is standing, in cleaned small pan slowly boil remaining 1/3 cup coconut milk with remaining 3 tablespoons sugar, stirring occasionally, 1 minute.
        Transfer sauce to a small bowl and chill until cool and thickened slightly.
        To serve, mold 1/4 cup servings of sticky rice on dessert plates.
        Drizzle desserts with sauce and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
        Divide mango slices among plates.

       1 small green, unripe papaya
        1 medium clove garlic, minced
        1 small red chile pepper, such as Thai bird, seeded and finely chopped
        2 tablespoons fish sauce, or soy sauce
        2 tablespoons vegetable oil
        3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice
        2 tablespoons brown sugar
        5 large green beans
        1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved
        2 cups bean sprouts
        1/4 cup coarsely chopped Thai or Italian basil, for garnish
        1/2 cup roasted peanuts or cashews, for garnish
        1/2 teaspoon granulated sugar, optional
        3 medium scallions, thinly sliced lengthwise
        Sticky rice for serving, optional
    </string>
    <string name="Instructions_food_11">
        Gather the ingredients.
        Peel the green papaya.
        Using the largest grater you have (such as one for scalloped potatoes), grate the green fruit, rotating it as you go to avoid hitting the inner seeds.
        If you do not have a grater, try a method used in Thailand: First, deeply score the flesh using a large, sharp knife.
        Then, run your knife just under the surface to release the shreds.
        In a small food chopper or processor, add the garlic, chile pepper, fish sauce, oil, lime juice, and brown sugar.
        Process until the liquid turns reddish from the chile. Set this salad dressing aside.
        Alternatively, pound the garlic and chile into a fine paste with a mortar and pestle or with the back of a knife.
        Transfer to a small bowl, add the fish sauce, oil, lime juice, and brown sugar, and whisk to combine.
        Slice the green beans into segments and add them to the chopper or processor.
        Pulse to lightly chop and bruise the beans. In Thailand, the beans are pounded to bruise them, but this method works just as well.
        Place the shredded papaya, cherry tomatoes, and bean sprouts in a large salad bowl.
        Add most of the basil, holding back some to be used as a garnish. Add the chile dressing and beans and toss.
        Add most of the peanuts, holding some back to be used for garnish, and toss again.
        Test for taste and adjust the flavor of salad as desired.
        If you would like a more intense flavor or extra saltiness, add an extra splash of fish or soy sauce.
        More chile can be added to make it spicier.
        If it is too sour, sprinkle a little white sugar over your salad and toss to mix (the sugar will melt in a minute or two).
        Garnish with the scallions, and the remaining basil and peanuts.
        Serve your salad as is or as a side dish to any Thai entree.
        If this is your main course, try serving it with a side of sticky rice like they do in Thailand.

        2-3 shallots (sliced thinly)
        3 tbsp fish sauce
        4 tbsp lime juice

        ¼ cup peanuts or cashew nuts (toasted)
        ½-1 cup vegetable oil

    <string name="Instructions_food_12">
        Cut the fish into chunks, season with soy sauce or salt, then steam for 5 mins until the meat is fully cooked.
        Set the fish aside to cool.
        In the meantime, prepare the mango salad.
        In a mortar, pound 2-3 bird’s eye chillies until there are no big chunks, then add palm sugar and mash to a paste.
        Add fish sauce and lime juice and mix until sugar is completely dissolved.
        Transfer paste to a bowl and add the shallots, dried shrimp, and julienned mango.
        Set aside to sit while you fry the fish.
        Once the fish is cool, transfer it to a bowl lined with muslin cloth.
        Wrap the cloth around the fish, twist, and squeeze as hard as you can to remove as much liquid as possible.
        Then, transfer the fish to a mortar and pestle and pound it until it’s fluffy with no chunks left.
        In a wok or a large pot, heat about 3 cm of oil over high heat.
        Now to put the fu (fluffiness) in the fish, the oil has to be heated to about 200℃.
        Once the oil is hot enough, sprinkle half of the fish into the oil.
        Be careful as the oil will bubble aggressively.
        While the fish cooks, try to tuck the edges of the fish and push the fish down to submerge in oil to fry and brown evenly.
        Once fish is golden brown, remove from oil with a slotted skimmer and set it on paper towels to drain.
        Place the fish on a serving plate and sprinkle with roasted peanuts.
        Garnish mango salad with chopped coriander (optional) and serve beside the fish.
        Serve the yum pla duk foo as a snack or as a main dish with steamed rice

    <string name="Title_desserts_2">mango sticky</string>
    <string name="Ingredients_desserts_2">
        1 cup Thai sweet rice (aka sticky rice)
        1 1/2 cups water, divided
        1 (13.5-ounce) can coconut milk, divided
        1/4 teaspoon salt
        4 to 5 tablespoons brown sugar, to taste, divided
        1 to 2 ripe mangoes
    </string>
    <string name="Instructions_desserts_2">
        Gather the ingredients.
        Soak the rice in 1 cup water in a medium pot for 20 to 30 minutes.
        Do not drain the rice.
        Add 1/2 cup more water, plus 1/2 can of the coconut milk, the salt, and 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar.
        Stir well.
        Bring to a gentle boil, then partially cover with a lid (leaving some room for steam to escape).
        Reduce heat to medium-low, or just until you get a gentle simmer.
        Simmer 20 to 30 minutes, or until the coconut water has been absorbed by the rice.
        Turn off the heat but leave the pot on the burner with the lid on tight.
        Allow it to sit for 5 to 10 minutes.
        To make the sauce, warm (do not boil) the remaining coconut milk over medium-low heat (about 5 minutes).
        Add 3 tablespoons brown sugar, stirring to dissolve. Taste-test sauce for sweetness, adding more sugar if desired.
        (Note that it will not taste as sweet once added to the rice.)
        Prepare the mangoes by cutting them open and slicing each into bite-sized pieces.
        Scoop some warm rice into each serving bowl, then drizzle lots of the sweet coconut sauce over the top.
        It should look like an English pudding with custard sauce, with the rice swimming in sauce.
        Arrange mango slices on the rice and finish with a drizzle of more sauce.
        Serve and enjoy.

    <string name="Title_desserts_3">thong yip</string>
    <string name="Ingredients_desserts_3">
        6 cups + 1 cup of water
        10 cups + 1 cup of castor sugar
        15 egg yolks
        4 to 10 tablespoons of Thong Yot flour, which is a wheat flour and rice flour mixture
    </string>
    <string name="Instructions_desserts_3">
        Make a heavy syrup from 6 cups of water and 10 cups of castor sugar.
        Make a lighter syrup from 1 cup of water and 1 cup of castor sugar.
        Strain the egg yolks through muslin.
        Squeeze.
        Blend the egg yolks until they are thick and fluffy; this can take 15-20 minutes.
        Put the egg batter in a bowl and add 4 tablespoons of flour.
        Mix well.
        Bring the heavy syrup to a rolling boil.
        Use your thumb, index and middle fingers to grasp some egg batter, lift it in a sweeping motion across the rim of the bowl, and drop it into the boiling syrup.
        Is the batter difficult to grasp? Mix in more flour until the batter reaches desired thickness.
        When a drop is ready, remove it from the boiling water and place it in the lighter syrup.
        Continue until all drops are ready.
        You can make many drops at once in the same pot, as long as you don’t put in so much batter that the water cools down and the boiling stops.
